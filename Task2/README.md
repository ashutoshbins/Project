## Social Media Sentiment Analyzer for Macro Influencers

### Overview
The **Social Media Sentiment Analyzer for Macro Influencers** is a tool designed to track and analyze the sentiment of social media commentary related to the tech industry. It gathers tweets from key influencers (e.g., government officials, top IT companies, and other influential figures) and assesses sentiment toward tech-related topics. By integrating a language model layer, the tool also identifies key tweets that might impact market sentiment, offering valuable insights for investors and analysts.

### Key Features:
- **Data Collection**: Uses **Tweepy** or **SNScrape** to gather tweets that mention specific keywords related to the tech industry (e.g., "tech regulation," "innovation," "deal," etc.), from key influencers such as government officials (e.g., Trump, Powell), central banks (e.g., FED, RBI), and top IT companies.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applies sentiment analysis tools like **VADER** or **TextBlob** to score each tweet as positive, negative, or neutral, allowing users to understand the general tone of the commentary.
- **Reporting**: Generates sentiment trends, with a weekly dashboard that presents simple visualizations (e.g., plots, graphs) to track sentiment over time and correlate it with potential market movements.

### Financial Importance:
- **Investor Behavior**: Social media sentiment, especially from influential figures, often correlates with market reactions. Understanding shifts in sentiment can help explain short-term price movements in IT stocks, offering valuable insights for investors.
- **Risk Assessment**: A sudden spike in negative sentiment may indicate growing market volatility or concerns, providing early signals that can inform risk management strategies for portfolios.

### Technology Stack:
- **Data Collection**: **Tweepy** or **SNScrape** to fetch tweets based on specific keywords.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Sentiment scoring using **VADER** or **TextBlob** to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral.
