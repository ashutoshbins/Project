## Simple Stock Movement Forecasting Tool

### Overview
The **Simple Stock Movement Forecasting Tool** is designed to predict short-term price movements of an IT stock index based on historical price data. By utilizing a basic regression model, this tool provides forecasts of next-day price changes, helping users make informed decisions for short-term investments.

### Key Features:
- **Data Collection**: Retrieves historical stock price data for an IT sector index using the Yahoo Finance API, ensuring that the model is trained with reliable and up-to-date information.
- **Modeling**: Utilizes linear regression, implemented with libraries like **scikit-learn**, to predict next-day price movements based on historical trends, volume, and other relevant factors.
- **Visualization**: Compares the actual vs. predicted prices through plots, enabling users to assess the accuracy and performance of the model.
- **Prediction**: Outputs short-term forecasts, providing a quantitative basis for investment decisions, such as entry and exit points for trades.

### Financial Importance:
- **Predictive Insights**: Even with a simple forecasting model, users can gain valuable insights into short-term market trends, which can inform investment decisions and risk management strategies.
- **Resource Allocation**: The tool helps investors and traders determine optimal times to enter or exit positions based on predicted market movements, improving resource allocation and decision-making.

### Technology Stack:
- **Data Retrieval**: Yahoo Finance API for collecting historical stock price data.
- **Modeling**: Linear regression implemented using **scikit-learn** for forecasting next-day price movements.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib or similar libraries for visualizing actual vs. predicted price trends.
